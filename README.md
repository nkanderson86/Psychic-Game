# Psychic Game 

Description: 

This game was my first attempt at creating a game using Javascript.  I originally tried to code the Word Guess Game but ultimately changed course to familiarize myself with the funadmentals before taking on the more challenging exercise.   

This game is quite simple, the computer selects a random letter from the alphabet and the user has a limited number of guesses to choose that letter.  If the user guesses the letter, a win alert pops up and the user is credited with a win.  If the user does not guess the letter before their guesses run out, then the user is credited with a loss and a loss alert pops up.  If the user tries to enter in a key that they've already guess, an alert will pop up and the available guesses will not be decremented. 

I was able to implement the following ideas from class for this project: 
- Event listener for user inputs from the keyboard
- If else statements to provide the game's logic
- updating the html elements using javascript


Roadmap:

This exercise was really eye opening and has left me wanting to practice a lot more.  I changed course on Friday afternoon so I didn't put any time into styling my game.  I'd like to do the following over the course of the weekend to polish things up:

- Add more bootstrap code to make it pretty 
- Add logic to exclude non-letter keys from guesses (ie: if user hits the space bar, it pops an alert saying "Please choose a letter")
- Set up the game to start on a specific key press, (ie: "Press space bar to start")

Thank you to the TAs for staying late on Friday to help me out with this! That was super clutch.
